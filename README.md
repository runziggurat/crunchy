# crunchy
P2P network crawler data cruncher for graph metrics


# Running

`crunchy` gets three command line parameters: an input file, and an output file and ip cache file. All of them are `JSON` files.

The input file is a sample generated by our zcash crawler. Its format (a JSON-RPC response) corresponds to this:


```
{
    jsonrpc: String,
    result: {
        num_known_nodes: usize,
        num_good_nodes: usize,
        num_known_connections: usize,
        num_versions: usize,
        protocol_versions: HashMap<u32, usize>,
        user_agents: HashMap<String, usize>,
        crawler_runtime: Duration,
        node_addrs: Vec<SocketAddr>,
        nodes_indices: NodesIndices,
    }
    id: usize,
}
```

The generated output contains processed data that our renderer can directly use. It looks like this:

```
{
    elapsed: f64,
    nodes: [
        addr: SocketAddr,
        betweenness: f64,
        closeness: f64,
        connections: Vec<usize>,
        geolocation: Option<GeoInfo>
    ]
}
```
Explaination of the node fields:

- `addr`: the address as a dotted quad, with port number
- `betweenness`: the computed betweenness
- `closeness`: the computed closeness
- `connections`: an array of indices corresponding to the connected nodes.
- `geolocation`: used for latitude, longitude, city, country

### Command Line

```
Usage: ziggurat-crunchy [OPTIONS]

Options:
  -i, --input-sample <INPUT_SAMPLE>    Input file with sample data to process (overrides input from config file)
  -o, --out-state <OUT_STATE>          Output file with state of the graph (overrides output from config file)
  -g, --geocache-file <GEOCACHE_FILE>  Output file with geolocation cache (overrides cache from config file)
  -c, --config-file <CONFIG_FILE>      Configuration file path (if none defaults will be assumed)
  -h, --help                           Print help
  -V, --version                        Print version
```

The command line also prints the network parameters before and after applying the IPS algorithm output. Parameters are printed in the following format:

IPS is described in details [ips.md](docs/ips.md).

Output can contain also information about some problems found, like nodes with assymetric connections, or nodes connected to themselves.

Example:
```
cargo run --release -- -i testdata/sample.json -o testdata/state.json -g testdata/geoip-cache.json
```
